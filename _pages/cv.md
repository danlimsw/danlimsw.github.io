Education
======
* Ph.D. Applied Physics, Harvard University, 2023
* B.S. Physics, California Institute of Technology, 2017
* Caltech Cambridge Scholar, Cambridge University, 2016

Work experience
======
* Nov 2023 - Present: Schmidt Science Fellow, Stanford Medicine
  * Advisor: Prof. Steve Chu
  * Developing novel ultrasound and photoacoustic medical imaging devices.

* Sep 2018 - Sep 2023: Doctoral Researcher, Harvard University
  * Advisor: Prof. Federico Capasso
  * Investigated counter-intuitive fundamental behavior of structured light fields containing optical singularities (``dark" regions of light).
  * Achieved a flat lens that uses extremely deep and narrow holes, the highest aspect ratio nanostructures for wavefront shaping as of publication.
  * Mentored an undergraduate (now PhD candidate, University of Toronto) and a high school student (now Harvard undergraduate).

* Jan 2018 - Jun 2018: Research Assistant, Bioprocessing Technology Institute, A*STAR
  * Modeled multiphase computational fluid dynamics  for inertial focusing in dense particle-laden flows.
 
* Jul 2016 - Dec 2017: Research Engineer, Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, A*STAR
  * Numerically simulated strong-field light-matter interactions in laser-based particle acceleration.
 
* Jan 2015 - Jun 2017: Undergraduate Researcher, California Institute of Technology
  * Advisor: Prof. Sandra Troian.
  * Fabricated microlens arrays in polymer with spatially-varying surface tension.
