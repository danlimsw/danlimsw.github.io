Experiments tend to be rather boring when they work precisely as expected. Mistakes and failure, though, are typically [nothing short of spectacular](https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/the-art-of-failure). This page celebrates art generated in the pursuit of science --- art generated either intentionally or unintentionally. 

## Microarchipelago (2016)

  <figcaption style="text-align:left;">I was producing miniature optical components by sculpting very thin films. These films love to detach themselves from surfaces, so in this experiment I was investigating if an adhesive layer would help to hold them down. This process involved a heating step, and to avoid destructive surface tension effects one first had to dry the sample. I forgot to perform this step and watched in horror as my perfect sample tore itself apart on the hotplate. While taking pictures of the sample under the microscope, I was struck by the beautiful iridescent patterns and agglomerates formed. It was reminiscent of a false-color topographic map of island groups, but these colors were real and breath-taking! I kept this image to remind myself that often failure in one domain can reveal insight or beauty in another.
