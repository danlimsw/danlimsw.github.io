Experiments tend to be rather boring when they work precisely as expected. Mistakes and failure, though, are typically [nothing short of spectacular](https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/the-art-of-failure). This page celebrates art generated in the pursuit of science --- art generated either intentionally or unintentionally.

  <figcaption style="text-align:left;">I was producing miniature optical components by sculpting very thin films. These films love to detach themselves from surfaces, so in this experiment I was investigating if an adhesive layer would help to hold them down. This process involved a heating step, and to avoid destructive surface tension effects one first had to dry the sample. I forgot to perform this step and watched in horror as my perfect sample tore itself apart on the hotplate. While taking pictures of the sample under the microscope, I was struck by the beautiful iridescent patterns and agglomerates formed. It was reminiscent of a false-color topographic map of island groups, but these colors were real and breath-taking! I kept this image to remind myself that often failure in one domain can reveal insight or beauty in another.

The sharp surface relief was created by deep reactive ion etching of silicon during nanofabrication optimization of the <a href="/files/lim-et-al-2021-a-high-aspect-ratio-inverse-designed-holey-metalens-1.pdf" target="_black">holey metalens</a> back etch.

  <figcaption style="text-align:left;"> Scaly tentacles dangle playfully from a blocky jellyfish head.

The block on top is made of platinum, which helps protect the underlying patterns while making cross-sectional ion beam cuts. Source: Daniel Lim and Maryna Meretska.
