I am an interdisciplinary applied physicist with a unique background in both life and physical sciences. I have research experience in mouse model studies of neurodegeneration, micro-optical device fabrication by harnessing surface tension, particle-laden computational fluid dynamics, neural network algorithmic tools for optimal design, nanoscale devices to control every degree of freedom in wavefronts, radiofrequency/ultrasound image reconstruction, and bioengineering for drug, protein, and gene delivery to cells.

My research interests are in the design of low-cost, high-accessibility medical diagnostics and therapeutics. 

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in Molecular and Cellular Biology studying intracellular delivery with [Prof. Steven Chu](https://www.stevechulab.com/) at Stanford University.

My undergraduate Physics degree is from the California Institute of Technology, with research mentorship from [Prof. Sandra Troian](http://troian.caltech.edu/) and a senior thesis in interfacial fluid dynamics and microfabrication. My doctoral work was with [Prof. Federico Capasso](https://capasso.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University on structured darkness, metasurfaces, and photonic inverse design. I am grateful to be supported by the [Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) in Singapore, having received the [National Science Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/national-science-scholarship-phd) for both B.S. and Ph.D. studies.
