# Welcome!

I am an interdisciplinary applied physicist with a unique background in both life and physical sciences. I have research experience in mouse model studies of neurodegeneration, through to self-assembled microstructured surfaces, micro-optical device fabrication with bespoke surface tension force fields, particle-laden computational fluid dynamics, and have worked in algorithmic tools, nanoscale devices, and system-level optics to exert arbitrary wavefront control. My work has applications ranging from atomic physics to bioimaging. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar studying medical imaging hardware and image reconstruction algorithms using ultrasound with [Prof. Steven Chu](https://www.stevechulab.com/) at Stanford University.

My undergraduate Physics degree is from the California Institute of Technology, with research mentorship from [Prof. Sandra Troian](http://troian.caltech.edu/) and a senior thesis in interfacial fluid dynamics and microfabrication. My doctoral work was with [Prof. Federico Capasso](https://capasso.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University on structured darkness, metasurfaces, and photonic inverse design. I am grateful to be supported by the [Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) in Singapore, having received the [National Science Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/national-science-scholarship-phd) for both B.S. and Ph.D. studies.
