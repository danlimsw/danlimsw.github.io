The Lim Lab at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) School of [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/mae) in Singapore designs transformational low-cost, high-accessibility medical diagnostics. We are a new research group opening in Semester 1 of 2026 (August/September 2026)! 

# Join us!
We are looking for founding adventurers at all levels (e.g., final year project undergraduates, Master's students, PhD candidates, research staff). Success not guaranteed; scientific excitement inevitable. Sounds like you? [See openings and contact information here.](join.md)

Candidates that seek admission for the August 2026 or January 2027 start dates should submit an application at the link [here](join.md).

# Personal background

Daniel is an interdisciplinary applied physicist with a unique background in both life and physical sciences. He has research experience in mouse model studies of neurodegeneration, micro-optical device fabrication by harnessing surface tension, particle-laden computational fluid dynamics, neural network algorithmic tools for optimal design, nanoscale devices to control every degree of freedom in wavefronts, radiofrequency/ultrasound image reconstruction, and bioengineering for drug, protein, and gene delivery to cells.

Daniel is jointly appointed at [NTU MAE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/mae) and the [Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/bii) in [A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/).

Daniel's undergraduate Physics degree is from the California Institute of Technology, with research mentorship from [Prof. Sandra Troian](http://troian.caltech.edu/) in interfacial fluid dynamics and microfabrication. His [doctoral work](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2892615112/fulltextPDF/6CD9A7EFBA8C4A6FPQ/) was with [Prof. Federico Capasso](https://capasso.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University on structured darkness, metasurfaces, and photonic inverse design. His postdoctoral work is with [Prof. Steven Chu](https://www.stevechulab.com/) at the Stanford University Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, supported by the [Schmidt Science Fellowship](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/). Daniel is grateful to be supported by the [Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) in Singapore, having received the [National Science Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/national-science-scholarship-phd) for both B.S. and Ph.D. studies.
