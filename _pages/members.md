## Join us!
We are looking for founding adventurers at all levels (e.g., final year project undergraduates, Master's students, PhD candidates, research staff). Success not guaranteed; scientific excitement inevitable. Sounds like you? [See openings and contact information here.](join.md)

Candidates that seek admission for the August 2026 start date should submit an application at the link [here](join.md) before 1 Nov 2026. 

## Expectations

Expectations for myself and the research group are "over-communicated" through a living continuously-updated document shared within the group, based on *Expectations* by [John Boothroyd](https://med.stanford.edu/boothroydlab), Stanford University (2022 revision). One section is quoted below.

As PI, I will strive to do what I can to:
* Create a research and learning environment where all are welcome, feel they belong, and feel supported to do ambitious work. 
* Be your scientific colleague and brainstorming-partner, striving to do science and engineering which benefits society at large. 
* Provide you with scientific and professional guidance that furthers *your* professional and long-term career goals.
* Provide honest and timely feedback that promotes *your* success. 
* Be fair, realistic, and equitable.
* Respect you and your time. 
* Give credit where credit is due, especially in public presentation of work done.
* Be a life-long mentor, to the extent that you choose to engage me in that role.
