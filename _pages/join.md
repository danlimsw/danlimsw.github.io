We are looking for founding adventurers at all levels (e.g., final year project undergraduates, Master's students, PhD candidates, research staff). Success not guaranteed; scientific excitement inevitable. Sounds like you? [Contact us here.](https://forms.gle/pw33Vd5LuwgMVA4NA)

Candidates that seek admission for the August 2026 start date should submit an application at the link [here](join.md) before 1 Nov 2026. 

# Openings

## Ph.D. student (Precision ultrasound detection for deep, high-resolution imaging)

A fully funded Ph.D. position is available for the design and development of an ultra-compact ultrasound detection platform. 

**Why is this important?** Ultrasound faces a fundamental depthâ€“resolution trade-off: deeper regions can only be imaged at low resolution. By guiding ultra-compact detectors to target sites, one can achieve high-resolution imaging at depth for early lesion detection with minimal invasiveness.

**What does this involve?** Design and prototyping of a miniaturized ultrasound detection platform, development of signal acquisition and beamforming/reconstruction pipelines, validation on phantoms and ex-vivo tissues with collaborators.

**Required background**: Classical wave theory, Fourier analysis, fluency in computer language of choice (Python, MATLAB, C++ preferred).

**Good to have**: Micro/nanofabrication, CAD, numerical simulation (e.g., COMSOL/Ansys/Tidy3D), electron microscopy, optical alignment and laser experience, electronics.

## Ph.D. student (Photoacoustic metamaterials for compact, broadband ultrasound sources)

A fully funded Ph.D. position is available for the design and development of a photoacoustic metamaterial platform for ultrasound generation in diagnostic radiology. 

**Why is this important?** Conventional ultrasound devices typically rely on bulky piezoelectric crystals driven by high voltages. A new class of compact ultrasound sources relies on artificial structured materials known as metamaterials and metasurfaces. These comprise tiny structures engineered to have bespoke mechanical, optical, or acoustic properties that may not be achievable in bulk materials, and are ideal for manipulating photoacoustic and acoustic emissions within a tiny form factor. A compact broadband ultrasound source is transformative for both *in vivo* diagnostics and high speed *ex vivo* tissue analysis. 

**What does this involve?** Design and fabrication of photoacoustic metamaterial elements, building of pulsed laser excitation and characterization setups; quantification of bandwidth, directivity, and efficiency, integration of sources with detection pipelines. 

**Required background**: Classical wave theory, fluency in computer language of choice (Python, MATLAB, C++ preferred).

**Good to have**: Micro/nanofabrication, numerical simulation (e.g., COMSOL/Ansys/Tidy3D), optical alignment and laser experience, electronics.

## Ph.D. student (Nonlinear ultrasound and AI-guided imaging for virtual biopsies)

One fully funded Ph.D. position is available for the design and development of a nonlinear ultrasound platform with AI-enabled human-in-the-loop acquisition. 

**Why is this important?** Conventional B-mode ultrasound imaging relies on structural information to produce contrast. It is not sensitive to other tissue properties which can contain critical diagnostic information, such as the presence of some cancerous lesions. Nonlinear ultrasound imaging which is sensitive to the high-order nonlinear coefficients of tissue is a promising capability with the potential to fill this gap. Combining nonlinear acquisition with AI-assisted guidance can move us toward *virtual biopsies* in resource-limited settings.

**What does this involve?** Development of nonlinear excitation/receive schemes and corresponding reconstruction pipelines; building of human-in-the-loop AI for acquisition guidance and artifact suppression, validation on phantoms and ex-vivo tissues with collaborators. 

**Required background**: Classical wave theory, linear algebra, fluency in computer language of choice (Python, MATLAB, C++ preferred), at least one ML stack (PyTorch preferred).

**Good to have:** Numerical simulation, computer vision (segmentation/registration).
